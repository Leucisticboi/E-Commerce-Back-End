## User Story
As a manager at an internet retail company, I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Description
This code functions as the back end for an e-commerce site. It allows the user to create, read, update, and delete important product information stored in a MySQL database. The database contains **four** data tables: 
    
`Category` for storing product category names and IDs

`Product` for storing product name, stock, price, and category IDs
    
`ProductTag` for storing associations between products and tags
    
`Tag` for storing tag names and IDs

The application utilizes an Express.js API that is configured to use Sequelize to interact with the MySQL database.
